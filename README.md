# Pokemon RayPlatinum

A Delta Patch for PKMN Platinum that adds my OC character over Lucas and includes additional areas to the game.

This game is still being developed as I learn more about Rom Hacking. This Repo will remain closed-source so as to refrain from any possible copyright violations.

---
### Planned Updates (not in order):

-Title screen update

-Dialouge update

-Sprite update

-Trainer update

-New locations update

-Additional Pokemon update

-Introduction of Mega Evolution (?)

---
### Known Glitches:

-Not every sprite for Lucas has been replaced yet, so many animations (i.e. HM, saving, Poketch, biking, etc. animations) will not be included until later releases.

-Ray is referred to as "Lucas" occassionally (support for other languages is not in the foreseeable future).

-Only the 3541 Platinum Rom is supported, as the 4997 version is not in my possession (yes, I work with *real* roms).
